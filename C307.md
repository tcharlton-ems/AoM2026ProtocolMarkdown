<h2 id="all">ALL</h2>
<p><strong>I. INCLUSION CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p>A. Recent cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>B. Patient has a palpable pulse.</p>
<p>C. Patient’s mental status may range from awake/alert to unresponsive.</p>
<p>D. Patient of any age.</p>
<h2 id="medic">Medic</h2>
<p><strong>II. EKG FINDINGS</strong></p>
<p>A. May vary from bradycardia to ST-segment elevation or depression.</p>
<h2 id="all-1">ALL</h2>
<p><strong>III. PROTOCOL</strong></p>
<p>A. Continue to follow protocol covering presumptive underlying cause of arrest.</p>
<p>B. In the first 10 minutes post ROSC, emerging data suggests a “stay and play” model to optimize care and interventions on the patient prior to transport. This may include preparing pressors, optimizing access and the airway, obtaining the diagnostic, and planning transport/moving the patient.</p>
<p>C. Maintain patent airway as needed and administer oxygen to correct hypoxia &lt;95%.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Until reliable measurement of SpO2 is established, it is reasonable to use the highest available oxygen concentration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyperoxia can be damaging on a cellular level. Avoid hyperoxia with oxygen titration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If patient shows signs of discomfort or pain, may consider the T715: Sedation after Intubation protocol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>D. Provide ventilatory support as needed. Avoid hyperventilation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adults – Respiratory rate of 10/minute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pediatrics – Respiratory rate for age/weight (utilize chart or see Appendix I)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventilation may be titrated with capnography once effective perfusion &amp; ventilation have been established and maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capnography is the best tool to guide ventilations. Maintain EtCO₂ within target range (typically 35–45 mmHg in adults) once effective circulation is established. Avoid hyperventilation. Use trends to guide care: stable values reflect adequate support; a gradual rise may indicate improving perfusion; a sudden fall may signal deterioration or impending arrest. In shock states, low EtCO₂ may reflect poor perfusion rather than inadequate ventilation—always interpret in context.</p>

</table><p>E. Keep defibrillator pads on patient, connected, and tracing cardiac electrical activity.</p>
<p>F. Monitor vital signs frequently. Rearrest after initial return of spontaneous circulation is common.</p>
<p>G. Notify receiving hospital and transport the patient.</p>
<h2 id="emt">EMT</h2>
<p>H. If available, request ALS back-up.</p>
<p>I. If no ALS available, initiate rapid transport to closest appropriate facility.</p>
<h2 id="all-2">ALL</h2>
<p>J. Transport destination determination</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Refer to the AOM ED capabilities survey for appropriate hospitals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow Trauma Triage Guidelines if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If cause of arrest is presumed cardiac, the patient should go to a hospital with 24-hour cardiac catheter lab availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the setting of prolonged transport, if the patient is stable and has no STEMI, it is reasonable to consider transport to cath lab capable center rather than critical access hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If STEMI is identified in the setting of a prolonged transport time, consider transport by critical care transport team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If patient is unresponsive and not following commands, transport to a hospital capable of therapeutic hypothermia / targeted temperature management.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="medic-1">Medic</h2>
<p>K. Initiate IV/IO access if not complete. Second access point is beneficial if possible.</p>
<p>L. Patients age 16 years old and older: aggressively treat hypotension (with MAP goal of &gt; 65 mmHg) with fluid bolus and push dose epinephrine per SB205 Hypotension.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Patients almost always have severe cardiogenic shock after cardiac arrest. This can manifest as pulmonary edema or vasodilation which makes vasopressor support the most effective management strategy. Crews should plan and prepare medications/therapeutics to manage impending hypotension from severe cardiogenic shock immediately after obtaining ROSC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare push dose epinephrine as described in SB205 Hypotension. Administer 10-20 mcg every 2 minutes to maintain MAP &gt; 65 mmHg.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>M. Maintain cardiac monitoring and continuous capnography.</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat arrhythmias per appropriate protocol</li>
</ol>
<p>N. A diagnostic ECG must be obtained as soon as feasible after ROSC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a STEMI is identified, the patient should go to a hospital with 24-hour cardiac catheter lab availability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given frequent changes over the initial post ROSC period, it is helpful to obtain an initial ASAP diagnostic EKG and one 10 minutes later.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>
<p>A. Over-ventilation reduces cerebral perfusion and may worsen neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest. Maintaining a normal ventilation rate may be helpful. Monitoring capnography can assist in the evaluation of ventilation.</p>
<p>B. Acute Coronary Syndromes (including ST-elevation myocardial infarction) are common causes of sudden cardiac arrest. Coronary thrombosis is one of the “T’s” to consider when managing a patient in cardiac arrest. Urgent reperfusion in a cardiac catheter lab with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is safe and effective in survivors of cardiac arrest. Thrombolytics are relatively contra-indicated after prolonged CPR, and urgent cardiac catheterization is better for those in cardiogenic shock.</p>
<p>C. Prehospital administration of a 2-liter bolus of chilled saline after ROSC is no longer recommended.</p>

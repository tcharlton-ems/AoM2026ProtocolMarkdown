<h2 id="all">ALL</h2>
<p><strong>I. INCLUSION CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p>A. Recent cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>B. Patient has a palpable pulse.</p>
<p>C. Patient’s mental status may range from awake/alert to unresponsive.</p>
<p>D. Patient of any age.</p>
<h2 id="medic">Medic</h2>
<p><strong>II. EKG FINDINGS</strong></p>
<p>A. May vary from bradycardia to ST-segment elevation or depression.</p>
<h2 id="all-1">ALL</h2>
<p><strong>III. PROTOCOL</strong></p>
<p>A. Continue to follow protocol covering presumptive underlying cause of arrest.</p>
<p>B. In the first 10 minutes post ROSC, emerging data suggests a “stay and play” model to optimize care and interventions on the patient prior to transport. This may include preparing pressors, optimizing access and the airway, obtaining the diagnostic, and planning transport/moving the patient.</p>
<p>C. Maintain patent airway as needed and administer oxygen to correct hypoxia &lt;95%.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Until reliable measurement of SpO2 is established, it is reasonable to use the highest available oxygen concentration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hyperoxia can be damaging on a cellular level. Avoid hyperoxia with oxygen titration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If patient shows signs of discomfort or pain, may consider the T715: Sedation after Intubation protocol.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>D. Provide ventilatory support as needed. Avoid hyperventilation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adults – Respiratory rate of 10/minute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pediatrics – Respiratory rate for age/weight (utilize chart or see Appendix I)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ventilation may be titrated with capnography once effective perfusion &amp; ventilation have been established and maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capnography is the best tool to guide ventilations. Maintain EtCO₂ within target range (typically 35–45 mmHg in adults) once effective circulation is established. Avoid hyperventilation. Use trends to guide care: stable values reflect adequate support; a gradual rise may indicate improving perfusion; a sudden fall may signal deterioration or impending arrest. In shock states, low EtCO₂ may reflect poor perfusion rather than inadequate ventilation—always interpret in context.</p>
